## Portfolio Project 
The goal of this project is to build a portofolio to showcase and demonstrate my learning and understanding of the languages and tools I have acquired and accumulated so far. The aim is to build a functional portfolio that will be the foundation of my final portfolio at the end of my course with _nology.

### Overview
In the building and creation of this project to satisfy the MVP criteria, I primarily used HTML, CSS and SCSS as well as Github and command line to drive the process. 

The expectation and inspiration for this project is to create a simple and functional portfolio that can grow with me as an artist and a junior software developer. The goal wasn't to create an fancy portfolio with all the bells and whistles. It was to tinker and continue to build my understanding of developing, the languages and how they work together to create an operational product that satisfies both the MVP criteria and myself. I encountered several challenges in the construction of this project ranging from simple to more complex difficulties. Using creative problem solving and other resources, I was able to overcome most. 

### MVP Criteria 
- landing page with name and title 
- about page that shares a snapshot of me '
- tech stacks with what I have learned so far
- project tiles with placeholder images and text that will eventually be replaced with projects as they come 
- contacts page with my links (email, Github profile and LinkedIn profile) 

### Challenges
- implementation of a navigation menu that caters to smaller screen sizes 
- hiding the brief project description when viewing in smaller screen sizes so as not to have too much visual clutter 

### Overcoming Challenges
- I wanted to implement JavaScript to create navigation that animates it entry and exit from the page. I invested great time and energy in trying to make this happen but when the challenge became too great, I turned to SCSS/CSS to make this happen, however, when the methods I were trying continued to bring failed results, I extended to coaches for guidanced to create a functional navigation button.
- Similarly with my project tiles, I first turned to my research skills to find a way to have 'polaroid' project tiles. By this I mean when viewing the project tiles on a mobile screen, I wanted only the project tile and image to be visible but did not want to eliminate the brief altogether. I wanted this available when the tile was clicked on. As I was working on this before the navigation button, I accidentally discovered pseudo-classes operated exactly in the way I wanted. I implemented this and was able to hide the brief until the user interacts with the project tile in mobile view. 

### Remaining Issue
- Styling: The nav button is too far in the top-right hand corner of the screen when in mobile view.
